# MVVM-C
My example of the MVVM-C architecture inspired by https://github.com/MarcoSantarossa/MVVM-C_with_Swift

What I've done here is remove all the dependencies to other frameworks like: 
- Mapper
- RxSwift

The purpose of this is to show the simplest yet cleanest version of what MVVM-C looks like on a codebase. Without the overhead of learning how other dependecies work.
